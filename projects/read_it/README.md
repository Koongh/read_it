# 📚 BookCompetitionWithRedeem — A Reward-Based Reading dApp on Algorand

## 🧠 Project Description

**BookCompetitionWithRedeem** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Algorand blockchain** that promotes reading through a fun, point-based competition system.  
Participants join a reading challenge, earn points, and unlock **redeemable codes** for reaching milestones.

This project demonstrates how to create **reward systems**, **user state tracking**, and **redeem logic** using **Algorand ARC4 smart contracts** — making it an excellent learning tool for blockchain beginners and developers.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Users **join a book competition** on-chain.
- Each participant earns points (added via contract interaction).
- When a user reaches **100 points**, they automatically earn a **unique redeem code**.
- Redeem codes can be **used once** to claim simulated rewards (like deposit bonuses).
- The system ensures fairness — each code can be used only once and is bound to the rightful owner.
